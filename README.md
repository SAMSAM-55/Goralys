# Goralys

Goralys is a lightweight web app to manage "Grand Oral" topics for students and teachers at a high school.

## Features

- Student/teacher/admin roles with automatic role detection at registration ([`AuthController::register`](backend/src/App/User/Controllers/AuthController.php)).
- Two-topic student workflow: draft, submit, and read-only once submitted ([`useSubjects`](app/hooks/useSubjects.ts), [`SubjectsController`](backend/src/App/Subjects/Controllers/SubjectsController.php)).
- Session-backed user data caching for fast frontend rendering ([`AuthController::login`](backend/src/App/User/Controllers/AuthController.php) manages session data).
- CSRF protection using a short-lived session token: [`CSRFService`](backend/src/App/Security/CSRF/Services/CSRFService.php) + [`fetchCsrfClient`](app/lib/fetch/fetch.client.ts).
- Toast notification system used by both PHP and Next.js ([`ToastController::showToast`](backend/src/App/Utils/Toast/Controllers/ToastController.php) and [`toast-provider.tsx`](app/ui/toast/toast-provider.tsx)).

## Quick start (development)

Prerequisites:
- PHP 8.1+ with mysqli
- Composer (for PHPMailer)
- pnpm package manager

To simulate a local PHP server with mysql on Windows, you can use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) (also available on Linux and macOS)

(Optional):
- PHP_CodeSniffer
- PHP ruleset for PSR-12 convention

Steps:
1. Run setup script:
   ```bash
   .\scripts\setup.bat
   ```
   Or if you use Linux:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
2. Configure environment:
    - For development, modify the values inside .env (created using setup.bat)
3. Database:
    - Create the database and tables using the schema at [backend/data_structure.sql](backend/data_structure.sql).
4. Run dev server:
    - Run Next and PHP's built-in server for the API. By default, the next rewrite port for the API is 80:
      ```bash
      pnpm run dev
      php -S localhost:80
      ```
5. Access the app:
    - Visit `http://localhost/goralys/` (or `http://localhost:8000` if using built-in server).

## Testing

You can use phpunit to run the unit tests for the backend in `backend/tests`.
To run the tests, use the following command after installing the project dependencies with composer:

```bash
.\backend\vendor\bin\phpunit --configuration backend\phpunit.xml
```

### Topic import

To test the topic import system, you can use the test file under the `assets/` folder ([test.zip](assets/test.zip)).
This can also help you understand the required format for Goralys topics import. If your data does not follow this exact
format, the system will not be able to import it successfully.

## Security notes

- CSRF:
    - Token validated by [`CSRFService::validate`](backend/src/App/Security/CSRF/Services/CSRFService.php).
- Passwords:
    - Passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash` ([`RegisterService::register`](backend/src/Core/User/Services/RegisterService.php)) and verified with `password_verify` ([`LoginService::login`](backend/src/Core/User/Services/LoginService.php)).
- Sensitive config:
    - You *must* use `.env` to configure your project.

*Note: the `develop` branch serves as a pre-production playground, so some commits may include experimental or buggy code — I try to minimize this as much as possible.*
